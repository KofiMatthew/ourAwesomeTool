These mock APIs are for returning test data so we don't have to:
	- eat into call limits
	- be online
	- wait for real data to be returned
	- expose API keys on Github (at least until demo)

Each mock api will:
	- accept a url string
	- asynchronously return test data in json format
	- throw errors in the console if something is clearly wrong with the url

To use the mock api:
	1) Link to the javascript file
	2) Comment out the AJAX code
	3) Replace that code with the corresponding test function
		 Use .then and .catch just the same as you would with AJAX
		 API names will be camel cased, non-hyphenated versions of the .js file names
		 
		 Example:
			
			var searchTerm = 'camelCase';
			var url = 'https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=opensearch&format=json&uselang=user&errorformat=plaintext&search=asdf' + searchTerm;

			callWikipedia(url)
				.then(response => { console.log(response) })
				.catch(err => { console.error(err) });
	
	4) Run the code and check for errors in the console
