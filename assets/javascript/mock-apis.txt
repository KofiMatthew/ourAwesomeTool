These mock APIs are for returning test data so we don't have to:
	- eat into call limits
	- be online
	- wait for real data to be returned
	- expose API keys on Github (at least until demo)

Each mock api will:
	- accept and parse a url string
	- return test data in json format
	- throw errors in the console if something is clearly wrong with the url

To use the mock api:
	1) Link to the javascript file
	2) Comment out any code that makes a real API request
	3) Replace that code with a function in this format: call[API name](url)
		API names will be camel cased, non-hyphenated versions of the .js file names
		example: callWikipedia(url)
	4) Run the code and check for errors in the console
